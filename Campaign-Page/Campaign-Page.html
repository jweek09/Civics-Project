        <p class="contentCardText sans">
            Woodrow Wilson's first campaign was a mixed bag for his career. The 1912 election was one focusing on
            reform, where the conservative Republican candidate at the time (William Howard Taft, incumbent) did not fit
            the agenda of the overwhelming majority of americans. The United States was in a time of industrial change,
            and as a response to it, progressive reform was in order. The 2 largest competitors to Wilson were the
            progressive party, run by their nominee Theodore Roosevelt, and the Socialist party who had nominated Eugene
            Debs. In the end, the only reason Wilson pulled ahead in the election is because Republican voters were
            split between the Progressive party and Republican party.

        <p class="contentCardText sans">
            When Wilson campaigned, he made a promise to reform the union, a promise which he entirely upheld during his
            presidency. Following his ideal of being a figure for the people instead of the government, Wilson acted
            more as a prime minister than a president during his presidency. He acted almost entirely through his
            party's presence in congress. Wilson, throughout his presidency, moved to expand the government rather than
            strengthen existing branches. This shows an appreciation for the checks and balances system in his
            operation. Through these methods, Wilson altered tariffs (taxes for internation trade), created the Federal
            Reserve system, strengthened labor unions, and created the Federal Trade Commission. Wilson, at the end of
            his presidency, made a push to acquire Roosevelt's voters from the last election to guarantee his reelection
            by making many reforms he had suggested in his campaign. However, Wilson's presidency was not all good.
            Wilson was indifferent towards the racism in the south, seeing it as a non-issue. He did not oppose racist
            remarks and ideals held by his southern cabinet members, and showed the pro-KKK film "The Birth of a Nation"
            in the White House.

        <h1 class="contentCardTitle sans">Wilson Avoids World War 1</h1>
        <p class="contentCardText sans">
            Woodrow Wilson made the choice to largely ignore the war at first. To him, it was not an immediately
            pressing issue and his time could be spent in other ways. However, in 1915, Germany's unrestricted submarine
            warfare doctrine lead to the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>, an American passenger ship which carried no
            munitions. Wilson was now forced to act, but he was still dedicated to keeping the United States out of the
            war. Wilson made the decision to send a note to Germany requesting that they stop the unrestricted submarine
            warfare and allow ships to travel freely. Germany claimed that the <i>Lusitania</i> had munitions on it and
            the sinking of the ship was fair, which prompted Wilson's second note. This time, Wilson not only requested
            the end of unrestricted warfare, but also denied Germany's claim of the British naval blockade on their
            coast being unfair. Wilson's sending of this note was considered provocative by some of his cabinet members,
            whom he promptly replaced and moved on. Wilson then sent a third note to Germany, this time an ultimatum,
            saying the sinking of any more ships would be seen as hostile and prompt war.

        <h1 class="contentCardTitle sans">Wilson's Second Campaign</h1>
        <p class="contentCardText sans">
            Wilson's second election was much more simple than his first. While Wilson's first campaign was prompt to
            tip over at any second, Wilson's actions as president were very popular and left him as a very popular
            incumbent candidate. On top of the popular political reform, Wilson campaigned on his ability to keep the
            states out of World War 1, which many citizens believed was the correct choice as opposed to entering the
            war. The republican party made a push to attract moderate voters opposed to Wilson's progressive ideals, but
            in the end, Wilson won by about 20 electoral votes. He would go on to begin his second presidency.

        <p class="contentCardText sans">
            Woodrow Wilson's second presidency was much more complex than his first. Germany was still attacking
            civilian ships, and the States' ideals started to turn against peace. Eventually, Germany pushed Wilson over
            the edge with the Zimmerman telegram, prompting Mexico to invade the United States in return for territory
            when Germany won the war. This made Wilson ask Congress to declare war on Germany and the Central Powers,
            which they promptly did. Wilson's involvement in the war was mostly in planning what would happen after it,
            as American manpower steamrolled through Europe. Wilson formulated the "Fourteen Points," a plan to make the
            world a more collaborative entity and bring about a time of peace. The points called for public discourse
            between nations, militaries being reduced to homeland defense only, open trade between all nations, and
            oppressed minorities being seperated from their oppressors. The points were meant to be put into place
            against Germany, but instead, Germany was hit with a much harsher punishment from the U.K. and France and
            the fourteen points were used as the foundation for the League of Nations, which Wilson is often considered
            the father of. However, at the end of his presidency, Congress ruled that the United States would not join
            the League of Nations, and the League eventually failed.
