        <p class="contentCardText">
            Woodrow Wilson's presidency had 2 large cons, that being the racism he let happen and his inability to
            enforce the League of Nations. While it's true that Wilson did not sign any racist laws, he did allow
            his cabinet members to be outwardly racist and refused to speak out about their actions. Woodrow Wilson
            also made minimal effort to sell the League of Nations to Congress back home, spending all of his time
            convincing nations abroad to adopt the fourteen points.

        <h1 class="contentCardTitle sans">Pros</h1>
        <p class="contentCardText">
            Woodrow Wilson's presidency had many pros. Most notably, his treatment of World War 1 was very effective
            and kept the United States out of the war with minimum compromise. Wilson's handling of global affairs
            is, in my opinion, the best take on globalism that a politician has presented so far. Had Wilson
            convinced Congress of the League of Nations' efficiency back home, there's a chance it would still be a
            standing politcal entity and it may have even prevented World War 2.
