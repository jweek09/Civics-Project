            <!-- Prepare for the yap sesh of the century -->
            Wilson was born in Staunton, Virginia on December 28, 1856. While he was still young, his family decided to
            move away to Augusta, Georgia. It was there in Augusta that Wilson would develop most of his ideals as a
            politician, having lived in a poverty-stricken area during the Civil War. Because of the war, Wilson's
            education in early life consisted almost entirely of teachings from his Father, who wanted the government to
            be reformed to be more similar to the British. Wilson began his studies with these ideals in mind in 1873 at
            Davidson College, North Carolina. He did not yet study political science but rather various contemporary
            arts. Because of concerns about his father's health, he dropped out after only one year, which led him to
            what is now Princeton University (then College of New Jersey). Wilson then went to study law at the
            University of Virginia, but left again after only one year to go back home for his cousin. After a fallout
            in their relationship, Wilson moved to Atlanta and self-studied, eventually passing the BAR and becoming a
            Lawyer. However, he was bored by lawyer work and soon left the field to go to John Hopkins University for
            political science. During this time, he found college boring and submitted multiple writings to magazines,
            and released scholarly papers still recognized today. On account of these releases, he became a professor at
            Wesleyan University before moving onto being president of Princeton University. During his time there, he
            reformed the school entirely with new courses, to be more similar to Oxford. He was removed from the
            position when he tried to make a common lunch standard, in line with his typically liberal views.

            <!-- Yap sesh #2 -->
            Wilson very briefly held the office of New Jersey governor after his removal from Princeton. In New Jersey,
            he established himself as a reformer, and extraordinarily progressive for the time that he was governor.
            Wilson campaigned saying he would be an "unconstitutional governor" and act on behalf of the people instead
            of the government. It was this ideal that led not only later won him the democratic nomination for
            president, but it was also this ideal that made him determined to keep the United States out of the war
            while he worked on reforming the union. His time as governor would come to an end with his resignation in
            1912 when he moved onto his presidential campaign.
